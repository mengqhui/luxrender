Please visit http://www.luxrender.net/wiki/Luxmax_integrated for latest information about Luxmax renderer.
We are not many developers working on this (currently two), so the information might not be updated as frequently as we would like,
but we try to update the documentation for each released version of Luxmax at least.

If you have any questions not answered in the wiki - then ask in the forum :
